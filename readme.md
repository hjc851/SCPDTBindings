# Embedded Source Code Plagiarism Detection Tools

This is a library containing embedded bindings for a number of Java source code plagiarism detection tools. Academic tools include:
* Sim
* Sherlock (Warwick)
* Sherlock (Sydney)
* Plaggie
* JPlag

It also includes naive implementations of text, token, tree and graph based plagiarism detection tools.

## Ownership

The referenced academic tools are owned by their original authors. I take no responsibility for any consequences of their use. 

The implemented bindings are my property, along with any supplementary code or libraries required for their integration. Future reuse must conform to the licensing of this repository.

The naive implementations of text, token, tree and graph based tools (naive tools) are my property alone. Future reuse must conform to the licensing of this repository.

I will not support the use of these bindings by a third party.
